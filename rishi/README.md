# Rishi — the shell of the Rye ecosystem

**Version:** `20260619.060512` (chronological; later is larger)
**Style:** Radiant (see `../context/RADIANT_STYLE.md`)
**Status:** First version — small, runnable, and growing

---

Rishi is the interactive-and-scripting shell of the Rye ecosystem: terse for the
hand, typed for safety, a sibling of Rye that shares its value model. The name
is a seer who hears the human and speaks faithfully to the machine — which is a
shell's whole work. Scripts carry the `.rish` extension. The reasoning behind
the name and the design lives in `../external-research/988_rishi_shell.md` and
`../active-designing/996_growing_a_language.md`.

## What This First Version Does

This version is honest about its size. It reads a `.rish` script and runs it,
supporting:

- **Comments** — a line beginning with `#`.
- **`let` bindings** — `let name = "a string"`, `let name = 42`, `let flag = true`,
  or `let copy = other` to carry an earlier value forward.
- **`say`** — `say "text with ${expr} woven in"`, evaluating each `${expr}` (a
  name, a field path, or a literal), or `say expr` to speak one value. Each `say`
  ends with a newline.
- **Lists** — `let xs = ["a" "b" "c"]`, written space-separated; a quoted element
  may hold spaces of its own. `say xs` shows `[a b c]`, and two lists are equal
  when their elements match in order.
- **Records** — `let r = { a: 1, b: "x", inner: { y: 2 } }`, comma-separated
  `name: value` fields. Read a field with `r.a`, nested with `r.inner.y`. `say r`
  shows `{a: 1, b: x, inner: {y: 2}}`, and two records are equal when they hold the
  same fields and values, in any order.
- **Comparison** — `a == b` and `a != b` yield a boolean; unlike kinds simply
  differ. The operator is found outside any quoted string, so `==` inside `"text"`
  stays text.
- **`contains`** — `xs contains value` yields a boolean, so membership reads as a
  fact and can be a gate: `assert allowed contains here`.
- **`run`** — `let result = run ["echo" "hello"]` executes a command and returns a
  record: `out` and `err` (the captured text), `code` (the exit status), and `ok`
  (true when the code is zero). A command that exits non-zero is an ordinary
  result; a command that cannot be spawned at all stops the script.
- **`map` and `where`** — `map xs as x: <expr>` transforms each element into a new
  list; `where xs as x: <pred>` keeps the elements whose boolean predicate holds.
  The body can project a field (`map people as p: p.name`), compare, or even
  `run` a command per element; the loop binding lives only inside the pipeline.
- **`assert`** — `assert <expr>` makes a fact a gate: when the expression is a
  false boolean, the script stops, says why, and exits non-zero. An optional
  `else "message"` gives the reason to show.

A short example, `tests/hello.rish`:

```
let who = "Rye"
let year = 2026
say "hello from Rishi, sibling of ${who}!"
say "the year is ${year}"
```

## Build and Run

Rishi is written in Rye (`src/main.rye`) and built by Rye itself — `rye build` —
against Rye's own standard library, so the language we are growing, the language
we write it in, and the language that builds it are one and the same:

```sh
mkdir -p rishi/bin
export RYE_ZIG="$PWD/vendor/zig-toolchain/zig"   # the toolchain Rye builds with
rye/bin/rye build rishi/src/main.rye -femit-bin=rishi/bin/rishi

rishi/bin/rishi version
rishi/bin/rishi run rishi/tests/hello.rish
rishi/bin/rishi run rishi/tests/checks.rish   # booleans, comparison, and assert
rishi/bin/rishi run rishi/tests/lists.rish    # lists, contains, and equality
rishi/bin/rishi run rishi/tests/records.rish  # records, field access, and equality
rishi/bin/rishi run rishi/tests/run.rish      # running commands, results as records
rishi/bin/rishi run rishi/tests/map_where.rish # transforming and filtering lists
```

`tests/checks.rish` shows the comparison-and-assert pieces, `tests/lists.rish` the
list-and-membership ones, `tests/records.rish` the records and field paths,
`tests/run.rish` a command run and read as a record, and `tests/map_where.rish` a
list transformed and filtered — each a run of facts that all hold. A false `assert`
instead stops the script, names the broken fact, and exits non-zero: the gate
behavior `parity.rish` will lean on.

## How It Grows

The first version is the seed; the destination is `parity.rish`, our parity gate
written in Rishi. Every piece it asks for is now in hand — the **list** that holds
a corpus, the **`run`** that executes a program and returns a record, the `==` that
compares (lists element by element), the **`map`** and **`where`** that walk and
filter, and the **`assert`** that gates. The next step is `parity.rish` itself: the
gate rewritten in our own shell, the child keeping watch over the parent. Each piece
shares Rye's value model, so a value made in a Rye program and a value carried
through a Rishi pipeline are the same value.

Two north stars guide that growth. `tests/hello.rish` is what runs today;
`examples/pond.rish` is where we are headed — an illustrative sketch of Rishi
composing a sandbox policy as a value and opening a **Pond** enclosure over
Caravan's isolation and Tally's bounded gardens. The reasoning lives in
`../external-research/987_pond_foundation.md`.

A note on the horizon: this version speaks through the same channel our test
programs use, so its output sits beside theirs. Routing `say` to standard output
in its own right is a small, early refinement on the way.

*May Rishi hear us truly and speak without distortion — small today, and growing
gently into a shell worth living in.*
