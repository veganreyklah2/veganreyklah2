# Session logs

Living index for the append-only session stream. Files sort ascending by stamp; this table reads **newest first**.

Naming follows [`context/specs/20260627-102012_one-clock-naming-law.md`](../context/specs/20260627-102012_one-clock-naming-law.md).

**Filename:** `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_short-slug.md` — no countdown prefix. **Body:** `**Stamp:**` in dot form (`YYYYMMDD.HHMMSS`); **Editor** and **Model** at the top per `.claude/rules/session-logs.md`.

**Commit discipline:** ship the log in the **same commit** as the work it records whenever possible. A follow-up commit only for the log is a last resort. Re-align the archive with `rye run tools/align_session_logs.rye`.
