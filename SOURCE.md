## What This Is

This is the whole path, start to finish, for someone brand new to coding who wants to stand where we stand: two homes for their code, a key to knock with at each, a seal that signs their name, an editor with a thoughtful AI at its side, and a gentle sandbox where that AI can work — and even sign commits — without ever touching the rest of the machine.

You do not need prior experience. Each step says what to do, and why it matters, so the shape of the thing makes sense as you build it. Wherever you see a placeholder like `youruser` or `you@example.com` or an `EXAMPLE…` fingerprint, put your own value in its place.

By the end you will have a repository that an AI agent can grow and **commit to, signed and verified, entirely from inside the sandbox** — nothing to sign by hand, nothing leaking out.

---

## The Shape of the Destination

Eight pieces fit together:

1. **Two accounts** — Codeberg (home) and GitHub (mirror).
2. **Two SSH keys** — one per forge, for authenticating pushes.
3. **One GPG key** — your signing seal, trusted by both forges.
4. **Fingerprint QR codes** — your keys turned into shareable art.
5. **Cursor** — the editor, with Claude in Agent mode.
6. **ai-jail** — the sandbox (becoming **Pond**, our TAME-style reimplementation in Rye).
7. **gitconfig + ssh config** — teaching the tools who you are.
8. **In-sandbox signing** — the quiet machinery that lets the agent sign for you.

Take them in order. Each rests on the one before.

---

## Step 1 — Two Homes for Your Code

Make two accounts. They are free.

- **Codeberg** — <https://codeberg.org> — a community-run, nonprofit forge. We treat it as home.
- **GitHub** — <https://github.com> — the largest forge. We keep a mirror here for reach.

Pick one handle and use it on both if you can, so your identity reads the same everywhere — for example, `youruser`. Verify your email on each account; the Verified badge later depends on it.

---

## Step 2 — Two Keys to Knock With (SSH)

An SSH key is how a forge knows it is really you pushing code. You make a **pair**: a private half that stays secret on your machine, and a public half you hand to the forge. We make one pair per forge, so each can be rotated on its own.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com codeberg" -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_codeberg
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "you@example.com github"   -f ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
```

Press Enter to accept the location; set a passphrase if you like (an agent can remember it for you). Now read each **public** half and add it to the matching account — Codeberg: *Settings → SSH/GPG Keys → Add Key*; GitHub: *Settings → SSH and GPG keys → New SSH key*:

```bash
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_codeberg.pub   # paste into Codeberg
cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github.pub     # paste into GitHub
```

Confirm each key's fingerprint any time with:

```bash
ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_codeberg.pub
# SHA256:EXAMPLEcodebergFINGERPRINTexampleEXAMPLEexample00
```

---

## Step 3 — One Seal for Your Name (GPG)

Where an SSH key proves *you may push*, a GPG key proves *you wrote this* — it signs your commits so each one carries your name with cryptographic weight. One signing key serves both forges.

```bash
gpg --quick-generate-key "Your Name <you@example.com>" ed25519 sign 2y
gpg --list-secret-keys --keyid-format=long      # note the 40-character fingerprint
```

Export the **public** half and add it to *both* forges' **GPG Keys** sections (the same place as SSH keys on Codeberg; *SSH and GPG keys* on GitHub):

```bash
gpg --armor --export EXAMPLEGPGFINGERPRINT0000000000000000000000
```

Your signing fingerprint, for your records, reads like:

```
EXA1 0756 6D9E 2793 AFD9  FF2A B078 5BAB 4DBF C172
```

The private half never leaves your keeping. The public half travels freely.

---

## Step 4 — Fingerprints as Art (Fira Code QR Codes)

A fingerprint is meant to be shared and checked. It is also, quietly, beautiful — and your AI agent can render it as art. Once Cursor is set up (Step 5), ask the agent, in plain words:

> "Turn my SSH and GPG fingerprints into QR code images, styled in Fira Code, one **portrait** and one **landscape**, for social media and my personal archive."

You will get clean, scannable images — one tall, one wide — that carry your keys' fingerprints in a typeface that loves code. Pin them to a profile, print them, keep them. They prove your identity to anyone who scans, and they look like you mean it.

---

## Step 5 — Your Hands and Eyes (Cursor + Claude)

Install **Cursor** from <https://cursor.com>, and subscribe to **Cursor Pro** or **Cursor Ultra** — the plans that give you generous access to the strongest models.

Open Cursor, enter **Agent mode**, and choose a **Claude** model (the Opus and Sonnet families are excellent partners for this kind of work). Agent mode lets the model read your project, run commands, and make changes with your blessing — which is exactly what the rest of this guide leans on.

---

## Step 6 — A Gentle Enclosure (ai-jail, becoming Pond)

We run the editor and its agent inside a sandbox, so they touch only the project folder — never your wider home, your keys, or your secrets. The tool is **ai-jail**.

> A note on the horizon: ai-jail is a Rust project we are grateful for, and our work in progress is **Pond** — a TAME-style reimplementation in our own language, Rye. A pond is a bounded, living enclosure rather than a cell: water held kindly within clear edges, where work can flourish in safety. Until Pond is ready, ai-jail is the enclosure.

Install ai-jail (it uses `bwrap` on Linux):

```bash
cargo install ai-jail            # or build from source; see github.com/akitaonrails/ai-jail
```

Cursor ships as an AppImage; unpack it once so the sandbox can launch it:

```bash
./Cursor-*.AppImage --appimage-extract     # creates ./squashfs-root
```

---

## Step 7 — Teaching the Tools Who You Are

Two small config files tie your identity to your work. On your **host** machine:

**`~/.ssh/config`** — which key opens which forge:

```
Host github.com
    HostName github.com
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_github
    IdentitiesOnly yes

Host codeberg.org
    HostName codeberg.org
    User git
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519_codeberg
    IdentitiesOnly yes
```

**`~/.gitconfig`** — your name, your email, and your signing seal:

```
[user]
    name = Your Name
    email = you@example.com
    signingkey = EXAMPLEGPGFINGERPRINT0000000000000000000000
[commit]
    gpgsign = true
[gpg]
    format = openpgp
[init]
    defaultBranch = main
```

With these in place, every commit you make on the host signs itself, and pushes find the right key.

---

## Step 8 — Signing Without Hands, Inside the Sandbox

Here is the heart of it. The sandbox is sealed: with a private home, it cannot see your host's `~/.gnupg`, `~/.ssh`, or `~/.config/gh`. So to let the agent push and sign from **inside**, we keep a small, deliberate set of project-local materials — each one gitignored, each one safe.

**8a. An allow-listing `.gitignore`.** When a repo lives inside a sandbox home shared with the editor and your files, ignore everything by default and allow back only the project. This guarantees keys and tokens can never be committed by accident:

```gitignore
/*
!/.gitignore
!/.gitmodules
!/SOURCE.md
!/context/
!/rye/
# ...your project directories...
/rye/bin/
*.rye.zig
.zig-cache/
```

**8b. SSH keys the sandbox can reach.** Place a copy of your forge SSH keys in a gitignored project folder (e.g. `.ssh/`), and point git at them — so pushes work from inside without your host keys:

```bash
git config --local core.sshCommand \
  "ssh -i $PWD/.ssh/id_ed25519_codeberg -i $PWD/.ssh/id_ed25519_github -o IdentitiesOnly=yes"
git remote add origin git@codeberg.org:youruser/yourrepo.git
git remote add github git@github.com:youruser/yourrepo.git
```

**8c. A dedicated, passphrase-free signing key — never your master.** Generate a small signing key that lives only in a gitignored sandbox keyring, so the agent can sign unattended. Your real master key stays on your host, untouched:

```bash
export GNUPGHOME="$PWD/.gnupg-rye"; mkdir -p "$GNUPGHOME"; chmod 700 "$GNUPGHOME"
gpg --batch --pinentry-mode loopback --passphrase '' \
    --quick-generate-key "Your Name <you@example.com>" ed25519 sign 2y
gpg --armor --export <NEW_SANDBOX_FPR> > "$GNUPGHOME/sandbox-pub.asc"   # upload to both forges' GPG keys
```

Wire git to sign with it through a tiny wrapper that always finds the sandbox keyring (so it survives restarts):

```bash
printf '#!/bin/sh\nexport GNUPGHOME=%s\nexec gpg "$@"\n' "$PWD/.gnupg-rye" > .gnupg-rye/gpg.sh
chmod +x .gnupg-rye/gpg.sh
git config --local user.name "Your Name"
git config --local user.email "you@example.com"
git config --local user.signingkey <NEW_SANDBOX_FPR>
git config --local commit.gpgsign true
git config --local gpg.program "$PWD/.gnupg-rye/gpg.sh"
```

Upload that sandbox key's **public** half to both forges' GPG Keys, and your in-sandbox commits will read **Verified** under your name.

**8d. The forge CLI, when you want it.** `gh` reads its token from your home, which the sandbox cannot see. Point it at a gitignored project copy instead:

```bash
cp -r ~/.config/gh ./.gh                        # on the host, once
GH_CONFIG_DIR="$PWD/.gh" gh repo create youruser/yourrepo --public   # from inside the sandbox
```

Use a short-lived, minimal-scope token, and remove `./.gh` when you are done.

---

## Step 9 — The Launch

From inside your project folder, start Cursor in the sandbox. This grants the editor only the current directory, closes the Docker socket, and keeps the GPU and your wider home out:

```bash
cd ~/yourrepo
ai-jail --private-home --no-docker -- ./squashfs-root/AppRun --no-sandbox \
  --user-data-dir="$PWD/.cursor-state/user-data" \
  --extensions-dir="$PWD/.cursor-state/extensions" "$PWD"
```

`--no-sandbox` here disables Chromium's own sandbox, which cannot nest inside `bwrap`; the real boundary is ai-jail's namespaces plus Landlock and seccomp. The display passes through so the window appears; everything else stays sealed.

---

## Verifying the Whole Thing

Inside the sandbox, ask your agent to make a small commit, then look:

```bash
git log --show-signature -1     # expect: "Good signature from Your Name"
git push origin main            # to Codeberg
git push github main            # to GitHub
```

Open the commit on each forge. When the green **Verified** appears, every piece is in place: your accounts, your keys, your seal, your sandbox, and an AI partner who can build and sign in your name without ever reaching past the garden wall.

---

## Why It Is Shaped This Way

- **SSH proves you may push; GPG proves you wrote it.** Two jobs, two keys, two uploads.
- **The master key never enters the sandbox.** A dedicated, revocable signing key does the daily work; if the sandbox were ever harmed, you revoke one small key, not your whole identity.
- **Everything sensitive is gitignored by an allow-list.** The repo cannot leak a key or a token, because it commits only what you name.
- **The sandbox is the boundary.** The agent works freely within the project and reaches nothing beyond it.

---

*May your keys hold steady. May each commit carry your name in good faith. May the enclosure keep you free — bounded, alive, and entirely your own.*
