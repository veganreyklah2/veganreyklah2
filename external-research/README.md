## What This Folder Is

This is where curiosity lands. The `external-research/` folder holds our explorations — the questions we chase, the experiments we run, the outside systems we study, the findings we want to keep close. Each exploration earns its own file, written so a reader can follow it start to finish, the way every piece in this project is written.

This folder is allowed to be experimental, informal, and overgrown at times. It is open to the world: it may name other projects, draw inspiration freely, and cite its sources, with the original works kept whole in the `gratitude/` folder. That openness is its purpose, and it is exactly what sets it apart from its disciplined sibling, the `active-designing/` stack, which carries only our own names and one fixed external and accrues slowly and intentionally. Here we roam; there we decide.

This file is the foundation stone. It rests at the bottom of the stack and explains how the stack works, so that anyone who opens this folder for the first time understands the shape of it at a glance.

## Redirect stubs

When an exploration **lands** (mission complete) or **moves** to active-designing, the numbered file becomes a **stub** — a short redirect, not deleted, so old links keep working. Stubs say **Deprecated** or **Executed**, name the stamp, and point at the canonical home.

| Stub | Canonical home |
|------|----------------|
| `20260621-051612_rishi-shell-redirect.md` | `active-designing/20260619-051312_the-faithful-hand.md`, `rishi/README.md` |
| `20260621-051612_shell-scripting-tame-redirect.md` | `tools/parity.rish`, gate trio |
| `20260621-051612_recommended-architecture-redirect.md` | `active-designing/20260618-184912_recommended-architecture.md` |

**Width policy:** interim seam manual [`968`](20260621-050312_usize-boundary-not-design.md); fork north star [`967`](20260621-051312_literal-usize-ban-language-fork.md) + [`../active-designing/20260621-051312_explicit-width-in-rye.md`](../active-designing/20260621-051312_explicit-width-in-rye.md).

**Retired patterns** (do not reintroduce in new research): Bash `parity.sh`, Python doc enrichers, permanent Tier C `usize` as destination, `init.arena` in prose (use `init.garden`).

## One clock, one order

Dated explorations carry `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_short-slug.md`; living documents (`README.md`, `TAME_GUIDANCE.md`) carry no stamp. Full naming law: [`../context/specs/20260627-102012_one-clock-naming-law.md`](../context/specs/20260627-102012_one-clock-naming-law.md).

## How To Add an Exploration

Adding research is a small, glad ritual:

- **Name the file with its stamp** in `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_short-slug.md` form, or as a living document when the work revises in place.
- **Name the slug for its subject.** A short, descriptive slug tells the reader where they are.
- **Write it in Radiant Style.** Lead with what you found. Favor active voice and affirmative framing. Weave the method together with its meaning, so the reader arrives at the insight through the description itself.
- **Say why.** Open with the question that prompted the exploration, so a future reader understands the motive as readily as the result.
- **Close when it is whole.** A finished exploration can end with a benediction or a plain summary of what we now know and what it opens next.

*May each question find its file. May the newest thought always greet the reader first. May this folder grow downward and upward at once — rooted in its foundation, reaching toward whatever we are curious about next.*
