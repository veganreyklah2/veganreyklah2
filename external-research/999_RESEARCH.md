## What This Folder Is

This is where curiosity lands. The `external-research/` folder holds our explorations — the questions we chase, the experiments we run, the outside systems we study, the findings we want to keep close. Each exploration earns its own file, written so a reader can follow it start to finish, the way every piece in this project is written.

This folder is allowed to be experimental, informal, and overgrown at times. It is open to the world: it may name other projects, draw inspiration freely, and cite its sources, with the original works kept whole in the `gratitude/` folder. That openness is its purpose, and it is exactly what sets it apart from its disciplined sibling, the `active-designing/` stack, which carries only our own names and one fixed external and accrues slowly and intentionally. Here we roam; there we decide.

This file, `999_RESEARCH.md`, is the foundation stone. It rests at the bottom of the stack and explains how the stack works, so that anyone who opens this folder for the first time understands the shape of it at a glance.

## Redirect stubs

When an exploration **lands** (mission complete) or **moves** to active-designing, the numbered file becomes a **stub** — a short redirect, not deleted, so old links keep working. Stubs say **Deprecated** or **Executed**, name the stamp, and point at the canonical home.

| Stub | Canonical home |
|------|----------------|
| `988_rishi_shell.md` | `active-designing/989_the_faithful_hand.md`, `rishi/README.md` |
| `990_shell_scripting_tame.md` | `tools/parity.rish`, gate trio |
| `992_recommended_architecture.md` | `active-designing/997_recommended_architecture.md` |

**Width policy:** interim seam manual [`968`](968_usize_boundary_not_design.md); fork north star [`967`](967_literal_usize_ban_language_fork.md) + [`../active-designing/970_explicit_width_in_rye.md`](../active-designing/970_explicit_width_in_rye.md).

**Retired patterns** (do not reintroduce in new research): Bash `parity.sh`, Python doc enrichers, permanent Tier C `usize` as destination, `init.arena` in prose (use `init.garden`).

## The Counting-Down Convention

Research documents carry a three-digit prefix, and the numbers count **down** as the work grows newer. This first file claims `999`. The next exploration takes `998`. The one after that takes `997`, and so the sequence descends, one step at a time.

The payoff is immediate and visible. Sort the folder alphabetically — the default view on GitHub, on Codeberg, in nearly every file browser — and the smallest number rises to the top. The newest research greets you first. The foundation rests last, holding everything up.

So the folder behaves like a stack. Each new exploration is a **push**: choose the next number down, write the file, and watch it settle onto the top of the pile. Reading top to bottom walks you from the freshest thought back through the history, all the way to this stone at the base.

```
external-research/
  996_<newest-exploration>.md     <- most recent, sorts first
  997_<earlier-exploration>.md
  998_<first-exploration>.md
  999_RESEARCH.md                 <- this foundation, sorts last
```

## How To Add an Exploration

Adding research is a small, glad ritual:

- **Take the next number down.** Look at the lowest prefix already present, subtract one, and that number is yours.
- **Name the file for its subject.** Follow the prefix with a short, descriptive slug — `997_zig_comptime_versioning.md` reads clearly and tells the reader where they are. Get the nouns and verbs right.
- **Write it in Radiant Style.** Lead with what you found. Favor active voice and affirmative framing. Weave the method together with its meaning, so the reader arrives at the insight through the description itself.
- **Say why.** Open with the question that prompted the exploration, so a future reader understands the motive as readily as the result.
- **Close when it is whole.** A finished exploration can end with a benediction or a plain summary of what we now know and what it opens next.

## Why Count Down Rather Than Up

Counting up is the common habit, and it serves logs and changelogs well. We count down on purpose, and the reason is the reader's first glance.

A reader opening `external-research/` wants the latest thinking, immediately, with no scrolling and no sorting by date. Descending prefixes deliver exactly that under plain alphabetical order — the order these tools already give us for free. The freshest work sits where the eye lands first, and the foundation holds steady at the base. We spend a moment of arithmetic when we push a new file, and in return every future reader is met by what matters most.

The convention also keeps the folder honest about time without leaning on timestamps in the name. The position on the stack tells the story: higher up is newer, lower down is older, and `999` is always home base.

## A Note on Reaching the Top

This scheme gives us room for a great many explorations before the numbers run thin, and that headroom will likely outlast the season of work it was made for. Should we ever approach the top of the count, we will treat it as a happy problem — a sign of a deep and curious folder — and widen the scheme with the same care we widen anything here. For now, the room ahead is generous, and the path is clear.

*May each question find its file. May the newest thought always greet the reader first. May this folder grow downward and upward at once — rooted in its foundation, reaching toward whatever we are curious about next.*
