## What the Almanac Holds

This is the field reference for building Rye. Every entry below was confirmed by code that compiled and ran, on the prebuilt Zig 0.16.0 toolchain we keep at `vendor/zig-toolchain`. When the toolchain's standard library surprised us — and the move to its new I/O model surprised us often — we wrote the truth down here, plainly, so the surprise becomes settled knowledge.

Read it as an almanac: practical, accumulated, seasonal. It grows as Rye grows.

## Rye v1 Stands on the Zig Toolchain

Rye's first version is honest about what it is: a thin front-end over the Zig 0.16.0 toolchain. A `.rye` file is Zig source for now, since the language has yet to diverge, so every capability the toolchain offers is Rye's by construction.

The one wrinkle we met immediately: the toolchain's front-end reads only the `.zig` extension. `zig run file.rye` answers `error: unrecognized file extension`. So the `rye` command bridges — it copies the `.rye` source to an adjacent `.zig` file, hands that to the compiler, and clears the bridge away afterward so the tree stays tidy. A single-file run needs nothing more.

Since then, Rye has taken its first steps away from the toolchain: it owns its standard library, and it counts its versions in its own way. The three entries that follow record how.

---

## Owning the Standard Library with `--zig-lib-dir`

A language earns its own standard library by hosting it. The compiler decides what `@import("std")` means by reading its **library directory**, and the flag `--zig-lib-dir <path>` lets us choose that directory. So Rye keeps its own at `rye/lib/`: the `std/` there is a copy of the toolchain's std we are free to tend, while the rest of the directory — `compiler_rt`, `libc`, the C headers, and the kindred runtime pieces — are relative symlinks back to the pinned toolchain, since we have no wish to change those yet. The `std` copy is about 18 MB; the symlinked remainder would have been some 230 MB, so linking rather than copying keeps the repository lean while still presenting the compiler a complete library tree.

The `rye` command passes `--zig-lib-dir rye/lib` on every run, and **insists** on it: before compiling, it confirms `rye/lib/std/std.zig` is present and refuses, loudly, to fall back to the backend's std. A wrong or missing path stops the run rather than quietly compiling against someone else's library. That insistence is the whole assurance — the proof that our std is in force lives in the path the compiler is handed — which is why `std` itself can stay a faithful, unmarked copy of Zig 0.16.0 that we diverge from one deliberate change at a time.

---

## The Version Lives in the Compiler, Not std

We learned this the honest way: there is no `std.version` in Zig. A language's version is a property of its *compiler*, surfaced through the compiler-generated `@import("builtin")` module as `builtin.zig_version` — a `std.SemanticVersion` with `major`, `minor`, and `patch`. Reaching for a hand-written `std.version` would both diverge our std needlessly and misplace the value, so we use the real mechanism instead, and a `.rye` program reads `builtin.zig_version` to learn the backend it stands upon.

Rye's own version lives where a distribution's version belongs — in the `rye` command — and it is **chronological**, our first deliberate divergence from Zig's semantic scheme. We also give the pinned backend a Rye-clock reading drawn from its real commit time (`20260413.181917` UTC for Zig 0.16.0), so `rye version` can show both truths at once without ever overwriting the backend's own.

---

## Finding the Library Beside the Binary

For `rye run` to point the compiler at `rye/lib`, the command must locate that directory at runtime. Zig 0.16.0 offers no `std.fs.selfExePath` — the I/O refactor moved such things — so we read the running binary's path from `/proc/self/exe` with `std.Io.Dir.readLinkAbsolute(io, "/proc/self/exe", &buf)`, take its directory with `std.fs.path.dirname`, and apply a hard-coded *relative* template, `../lib`. Because the template resolves against the binary's real location, it holds no matter where the repository is cloned; an explicit `RYE_LIB` environment variable overrides it on a host without `/proc`. A small `comptime` assertion keeps the template honest — non-empty, and relative, never an absolute path baked in.

---

## The Entry Point: the Init Handshake

Zig 0.16.0 changed how a program begins, and the change is a gift to clarity. A `main` function may now accept one argument, `std.process.Init`, and the runtime hands it everything a program needs, explicitly, rather than through hidden globals:

- `init.minimal.args` — the command-line arguments.
- `init.minimal.environ` — the environment.
- `init.arena` — a process-wide arena allocator, cleared automatically on exit.
- `init.gpa` — a general-purpose allocator for finer-grained, freed-as-you-go work.
- `init.io` — the I/O implementation, threaded explicitly through every operation that touches the outside world.
- `init.environ_map` — the environment parsed into a lookup map.
- `init.preopens` — files handed down by the parent process.

`main` may return `void`, `!void`, `noreturn`, `u8`, or `!u8`. Returning `!u8` is the clean way to give an exit code: the value flows straight out as the process's status, with no separate exit call needed.

---

## Arguments and the Environment

The familiar `argsAlloc` is gone. Arguments now arrive through the `Init` handshake and become a slice with one call:

- `const args = try init.minimal.args.toSlice(allocator);` yields `[]const [:0]const u8`.

Environment lookups are equally direct, through the parsed map:

- `const value = init.environ_map.get("RYE_ZIG");` yields `?[]const u8`.

The `rye` command uses exactly these: the first to read its subcommand and file, the second to find its toolchain through the `RYE_ZIG` variable.

---

## The I/O Model: `io`, Threaded Explicitly

The largest change in 0.16.0 is that input and output flow through an explicit `io` value rather than ambient global state. This is deeply in the spirit we already keep: nothing reaches the outside world by surprise; the capability is passed, plainly, to whatever uses it.

In practice this means the old `std.fs` is now a deprecated doorway to `std.Io.Dir`, and the filesystem calls take `io`:

- `const dir = std.Io.Dir.cwd();` — open the current directory (no `io` needed for this one).
- `dir.readFileAlloc(io, sub_path, allocator, limit)` — read a whole file; `limit` may be `.unlimited`.
- `dir.writeFile(io, .{ .sub_path = path, .data = bytes })` — write a file.
- `dir.deleteFile(io, sub_path)` — remove one.

Path helpers such as `std.fs.path.basename` still work; they are pure string work and need no `io`. And `std.debug.print` still takes the familiar format strings — `{s}` for a string, `{d}` for a number — which kept our diagnostics simple. For an error value, `@errorName(err)` with `{s}` prints its name reliably.

---

## Spawning the Toolchain

The `rye` command runs a `.rye` file by handing the bridged `.zig` to the toolchain as a child process. The spawn likewise takes `io`:

- `var child = try std.process.spawn(io, .{ .argv = argv });` — `argv` is `[]const []const u8`, its first element the program to run.
- `const term = try child.wait(io);` — wait for completion, yielding a `Term`.

A `Term` reports how the child ended: `.exited` carries a `u8` status, and `.signal`, `.stopped`, and `.unknown` cover the rest. The `rye` command returns the child's `.exited` code as its own, so a failing `.rye` program surfaces its failure honestly.

A small kindness in the defaults: the child's standard input, output, and error all `inherit` from the parent unless asked otherwise, so a program's output streams straight to the terminal with no plumbing on our part. When `argv[0]` holds a path with a slash, it is run as that path; otherwise it is resolved through the parent's PATH. We pass an absolute toolchain path through `RYE_ZIG`, so the backend in use is never in doubt.

---

## Memory, the Tally Way

The first run of the `rye` command worked and printed the right answer — and the debug allocator then reported several leaks. The lesson was clean and on-theme. We had allocated from `init.gpa`, the leak-checking general allocator, and never freed, so it rightly complained.

The fix is the region model we already cherish, here named Tally in our designs: allocate a short-lived command's memory from `init.arena.allocator()`. The arena is one garden, cleared whole by the runtime on exit, so there is nothing to track and nothing to leak. Switching the command's allocations to the arena turned a noisy run into a silent, clean one. The guidance settles simply: for whole-command, live-until-exit allocations, reach for the arena; reserve the freed-as-you-go allocator for memory with a shorter, finer lifetime.

## SHA3-512 Parity

The first thing we asked Rye to prove was that SHA3-512 works exactly as it does in Zig 0.16.0. It does, by the only honest measure: a known-correct digest, matched.

The standard library offers `std.crypto.hash.sha3.Sha3_512`, with a `digest_length` of 64 bytes and a one-call form, `Sha3_512.hash(message, &digest, .{})`. We hashed the bytes `"Rye"`, rendered the digest as lowercase hex by hand, and asserted it against a digest computed independently beforehand. It matched to the last nibble:

```
SHA3-512("Rye") = c692f0476279e6b867ee66c6701c119106a38f46881da52d733ac2b0cd092e96
                  30249106dba551524678e70cea61686016926bdc984a191d055b329f2336763f
```

Because Rye v1 is the toolchain under a new name, this is not an approximation of Zig's cryptography — it is the very same code, confirmed.

---

## Building and Running

Two paths, both confirmed:

- **The toolchain.** We fetched the official prebuilt Zig 0.16.0 release, verified its SHA-256 against the published sum before trusting a byte, and keep it at `vendor/zig-toolchain`. Verifying the artifact before use is the safe habit, and it cost nothing.
- **The build.** `zig build-exe rye/src/main.zig -femit-bin=rye/bin/rye` produces the `rye` command directly. With the toolchain on hand, `rye run rye/tests/sha3_512_test.rye` compiles and runs the test, printing the digest and confirming parity.

## A Freestanding Hart on RISC-V

The first time Rye left the operating system behind, it woke a bare-metal hart. `rye build` — the new sibling of `rye run` — hands the bridged source to `zig build-exe` rather than `zig run`, so Rye emits a binary; flags after the file pass straight through, which is how a freestanding target gets chosen. Aiming at `riscv64-freestanding-none` and running the result on `qemu-system-riscv64 -machine virt` taught a handful of lessons worth keeping.

- **The code model matters at the top of RAM.** QEMU's `virt` machine places RAM at `0x8000_0000`, and the default `medlow` code model cannot address a symbol there — its `lui`-based `R_RISCV_HI20` relocation overflows a signed 20-bit field by exactly one (`524288`, where `524287` is the maximum). The fix is the `medany` model, which Zig spells `-mcmodel=medium`: it addresses symbols PC-relative (`auipc`) and so reaches anywhere. This is the canonical RISC-V bare-metal stumble, and the linker error names it precisely once you know to read it.
- **A hart wakes with no stack.** At reset the stack pointer is undefined, so the entry point cannot be an ordinary function — its prologue would write through a garbage `sp`. We make `_start` `callconv(.naked)` so no prologue runs, set `sp` to real memory with a single `li`, and `j` to a normal function that may now use a stack freely.
- **Placement is the linker script's job.** With `-bios none`, the machine begins executing at `0x8000_0000`, so `_start` must live exactly there. We give it its own section, `.text.init`, and a tiny linker script (`ENTRY(_start)`; `. = 0x80000000`; `KEEP(*(.text.init))` placed first) that lays it at the base of RAM. `-fno-entry` tells the toolchain we provide the entry ourselves.
- **The machine has two useful edges.** The `virt` console UART sits at `0x1000_0000`: write a byte to its transmit register and it appears on the console. The SiFive test device sits at `0x10_0000`: write `0x5555` and the machine powers off, handing a clean exit (`0`) back to the host — which is how the seed ends without hanging the emulator.

The whole thing is one command, `aurora/run-seed.sh`, and it dogfoods Rye end to end: Rye's own toolchain builds the binary, against Rye's own `std`, and the emulator wakes it. The seed lives in `../aurora/`.

---

## Open Threads

A few paths we have left lit for later, each a deliberate choice rather than an oversight:

- **Self-hosting the `rye` command.** For now it is a small Zig program. As Rye finds its own shape, the command can be written in Rye itself — the natural end state.
- **A `build.rye` story.** `rye build` now compiles a single `.rye` file to a binary, freestanding targets included. Zig builds *whole projects* through a `build.zig` script; Rye will want its own `build.rye` for many-file programs, bridged the same way single files are today.
- **A bounded read.** The command reads a source file with an unlimited size; a future version can bound it, in keeping with putting a limit on everything.
- **Many-file programs.** The single-file bridge serves the first version; multi-file `.rye` projects, with their imports, are a thread to pick up next.
- **Pond.** The `ai-jail` sandbox we work inside is a Rust project; re-growing it as a gentle, TAME-style enclosure in Rye — Pond — is a thread we mean to follow once the language stands on more of its own.

*May each finding here stay true, and may the next builder trust it. May the gardens we allocate clear cleanly, the digests we compute match to the last nibble, and the language we grow stand surely on ground we have tested ourselves.*
