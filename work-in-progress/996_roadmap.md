# 996 · The Roadmap — Growing the Whole from What Already Works

*A living plan for the work ahead, shaped by one law we hold close: a complex system that works grows from a simpler system that worked. So this roadmap never points straight at the finished, intricate whole. It lays out horizons — what runs now, what comes next, what composes from those, and the ambitious ends — and for each larger system it names the smaller working ones it is made of. We build by growing, and we ship something simple that runs at every step.*

## The Shape of This Plan

This plan draws its discipline from the active-designing stack: simplicity as single-stranded parts composed (`995`), the method of growing a language from proven ground (`996`), the gates that prove each step (`998`), the architecture the parts compose into (`997`), and the decision that Rye is its own language (`../context/specs/rye-as-its-own-language.md`). Above all it keeps Gall's Law: we reach for the smallest version that works, and let it become the larger one by degrees. No milestone here is built whole from scratch; each grows from the working systems beneath it.

---

## Horizon 0 — What Already Works (the ground we stand on)

These are the simple systems that run today. Everything ahead grows from them.

- **Rye runs, and is written in Rye** — a Zig-0.16 derivative with its own standard library and its own chronological versioning. The `rye` command (`run` and `build`) is itself a `.rye` program; Rye bootstraps once, then self-hosts its own build.
- **Aurora wakes on RISC-V, and grows stage by stage** — `rye build` emits a freestanding RISC-V binary that `qemu-system-riscv64` runs, through six living stages: a seed (a hart wakes, speaks one asserted line, halts), a three-stage relay (a boot as a flow of named values, each asserted), a content-named hart (SHA3-512 on bare metal), a whole sealed message (X25519 + AEAD + SHA3 + Ed25519, sealed and opened freestanding), and — across two harts — the wire (a shared-memory mailbox) and a posted datagram.
- **A sealed datagram crosses between two harts** — Alice seals on hart 0; Bob, on hart 1, reads the raw bytes off a shared-memory wire, shape-casts them, verifies the attestation, confirms the content-name, derives the shared secret from his own key, and opens it. The content-name matches the hosted test byte-for-byte: the move that turns the whole networking arc into something that runs, running.
- **The strengthening series is live** — SHA3-512, the Keccak sponge beneath it, and the everyday `std` our own tools lean on (`mem.trim`, `mem.eql`, `mem.findScalar`, `fmt.parseInt`), each given stated invariants and each parity-green, recorded in the strengthening-compiler stack.
- **The crypto foundation is proven, primitive by primitive** — the content hash (SHA3-512, strengthened), signing (Ed25519), key agreement (X25519), and the authenticated seal (AEAD: ChaCha20-Poly1305) all run in Rye's own std, hosted and freestanding alike, and stand parity-green: the foundation the network and identity rest on (`../strengthening-compiler/9995`).
- **The gate trio runs** — `parity.sh` (behavior identical to baseline), `parity-selftest.sh` (the gate turns red on a real divergence), `additive-gate.sh` (a pass changed only assertions and words). Strengthening is safe by construction; the corpus now carries eight programs, all green, and the gate is written in portable shell so it runs anywhere.
- **Rishi runs** — a shell interpreter in Rye with comments; `let` of strings, integers, booleans, lists, and records; string interpolation that composes a value into text (`"${a}/${b}"`); `say`; `==`/`!=` comparison; list membership with `contains`; field access with `record.field`; running a command with `run` (its result a record of `out`, `err`, `code`, `ok`); transforming and filtering lists with `map` and `where`; and `assert` as a gate that exits non-zero with its reason. Built by `rye build`.
- **Rishi gained arithmetic and a real stdout** — integer `+`/`-`/`×`/`÷` with correct operator precedence via two-layer recursive descent, parenthesized grouping, and `say` rebound from stderr to stdout. Nine arithmetic assertions in `rishi/tests/arithmetic.rish`, all green. The shell can now compute, compose, and speak.
- **The parity gate runs in Rishi** — `tools/parity.rish` is `parity.sh` reborn in our own shell: it maps the corpus through `run` against the baseline and strengthened std, compares the two lists of outputs as one value, and asserts the verdict. Proven GREEN across the corpus and RED on an injected divergence — so the shell Rye grew now guards Rye's own becoming.

## Horizon 1 — Short-Term (the next simple systems, each small and proven)

Each is a thing that runs on its own, added by degrees, behind the gates.

- [ ] **The wire as a real device** — carry a sealed datagram over an emulated `virtio-net` between two QEMU machines, growing the two-hart shared-memory wire (done, Horizon 0) into a true network link. A device driver and two communicating instances: the meatier climb where Comlink fully begins.
- [ ] **Caravan seed — one parent, one child, restart on fall** — the smallest living supervision loop in hosted Rye: a parent that never dies, one child, restart when the child falls, proven by assertion (`../active-designing/987`). Grows toward Caravan v1; runs **in parallel** with the device-wire so design does not outrun code.
- [x] **Tally seed — one region, asserted edges** — one bounded `Region` struct over a caller-provided backing slice; bump allocate within stated edges, fail past the boundary, clear whole in one gesture. 13 hosted `debug.assert` calls, all green (`tally/seed.rye`). Grows toward Tally v1.
- [ ] **Close reading of cloned sources** — packet format, commit rule, relay protocols from what we vendored in `gratitude/`, with actionable notes for Comlink before the wire format hardens (`995`, `10007`).
- [ ] **Aurora's deciding stage** — a relay stage that hands the next a value *it chose*, not only one it read: the seed of a boot that selects what runs next.
- [x] **Grew Rishi to `parity.rish`** — shipped one proven feature at a time: `==`/`!=`, `assert`, lists, `contains`, records with field access, `run`, `map`/`where`, and string interpolation — and then the gate itself (Horizon 2 below, reached early). `tools/parity.rish` runs GREEN, and RED on a real divergence.
- [ ] **Strengthening passes 9994–9991** — four ordered passes Mantra's seed depends on: SHA3-256 (9994), mem diff primitives — `mem.copy`, `mem.startsWith`, `mem.endsWith`, `mem.indexOf`, `mem.split` (9993), `std.fs` boundary assertions (9992), and `Dir.iterate` (9991). Each through the gate trio before the next begins.
- [ ] **River and Ghostty into `gratitude/`** — clone both display-layer references before Brushstroke's native backend hardens; actionable reading for the OS-boundary wrapping discipline (`../active-designing/985`).
- [ ] **Rishi file I/O builtins** — `open`, `read`, `write`, `close` at minimum, behind the OS-boundary wrappers (`../active-designing/985`). Both Mantra and Brushstroke need shell-level file access.
- [ ] **Mantra seed** — the smallest weave: two text buffers in, one always-succeeding merge out, content-named by SHA3-256. Depends on the 9994–9991 strengthening passes and Rishi file I/O.
- [ ] **Brushstroke seed** — one native window on x86_64 AMD, one static frame drawn via the display layer protocol, libghostty thin costume for the text area. Depends on River and Ghostty in `gratitude/` and the OS interface wrappers (`../active-designing/985`, `../active-designing/986`).
- [ ] **Continue the strengthening series** — the next `std` surfaces our tools depend on, each through the gate trio, each recorded in the strengthening-compiler stack.

---

## Horizon 2 — Medium-Term (compose the simples into larger working systems)

Each milestone here is *made of* the working systems above.

- [x] **`parity.rish` runs** — made of: Rishi (lists, records, `run`, `map`/`where`, interpolation, `assert`) + the parity logic. The gate, rewritten in our own shell — proven GREEN, and RED on a real divergence (`../tools/parity.rish`).
- [ ] **Comlink v1 — the network module** *(see `../external-research/981`)* — made of: the encrypted-datagram seed grown into typed, content-named, sealed message delivery, exactly-once by hash, carrying values between identities.
- [ ] **Unified keys v1** — made of: one owner seed deriving the keys a person needs (ed25519 for SSH/GPG/Sui, secp256k1 for Nostr), separated for safety and recovered as one (`../external-research/981`).
- [ ] **Silo v1** — made of: a content-addressed store (grown from the smallest working build of one thing) + a single lawful compose combinator. Describes a simple system reproducibly.
- [ ] **Tally v1** — made of: the process-garden pattern Rye already uses, grown into a named, bounded region allocator with asserted edges.
- [ ] **Caravan v1** — made of: the simplest working supervision (one parent that never dies, one child, restart on fall), grown toward a small tree and chain-loaded startup.
- [ ] **Pond v1** — made of: Caravan v1's isolation **composed with** Tally v1's bounds — one allow-listed path, one resource bound, opened from a policy that is a value (`pond.rish`).
- [ ] **Mantra for `~/veganreyklah2`** — made of: Mantra seed grown into Rishi shell commands that track a real weave of our development repository; content-named, always-succeeding merge live in the shell.
- [ ] **Silo minimum** — made of: one `.silo` record descriptor readable by Rishi, describing a simple system reproducibly. The first floor toward Silo v1.
- [ ] **Pond GUI — Rishi REPL + Mantra in a Brushstroke window** — made of: Brushstroke seed + Mantra seed + Rishi file I/O, composing into a single native x86_64 window with a Rishi text area and live Mantra version control of the repository (`../expanding-prompts/10009`, `../active-designing/986`).

## Horizon 3 — Ambitious Milestones (the complex wholes, each grown from the working parts)

The far ends. Each is named with the simpler working systems it is composed of, so the path to it is always a growing, never a leap.

- [ ] **Rye, a genuinely separate language** — made of: the strengthened `std` + a growing divergence in syntax and semantics, including borrow-checking-style guarantees over Tally's gardens (`../external-research/983`), compiling to RISC-V as a first-class target. Grown from the Zig-derivative, never rewritten from scratch.
- [ ] **The full family, composing through one value model** — made of: Rye + Silo + Rishi + the orchestration language + Mantra + Comlink, each grown from its v1, sharing one value model so values flow seam-free from a keystroke to the wire.
- [ ] **The content-centric messenger** — made of: Comlink + Mantra + unified keys + Rishi's `talk` — an IRC-meets-Dojo where a message is a named, sealed value carried home (`../external-research/982`).
- [ ] **The devotional social layer** — made of: the messenger + Nostr-simple store-and-forward relays on our coherent core, curated by honest structure, true to the values (`../external-research/984`).
- [ ] **The fractal address space** — made of: unified keys + a derivation tree shaped as galaxies, stars, and planets (d5 × d12 = d60), with admins who coordinate and never command (`../external-research/981`).
- [ ] **Aurora — the boot on RISC-V** — made of: the seed and relay, grown stage by stage into a verified, named-value boot from an immutable root.
- [ ] **Pond — a trustworthy daily enclosure** — made of: Pond v1, hardened pass by pass over Caravan's isolation and Tally's gardens, until it is the room our agents work inside.
- [ ] **Brushstroke, web-portable** — made of: Brushstroke seed grown with a `wasm32-freestanding` backend, so any Pond application runs in a browser surface without rewriting. The same frame-garden discipline, the same widget seam, a different surface below.
- [ ] **A self-hosted, RISC-V-cohesive Rye system** — made of: Aurora (boot) + Caravan (kernel) + Tally (memory) + Silo (configuration) + Mantra (memory of the system) + Comlink (the network) + Rishi (the hand) + Pond (the enclosure) — the whole machine, grown from every working part beneath it, belonging wholly to the one who runs it.

## The Discipline This Plan Obeys

- **Ship something simple that runs at every step.** A thing that runs, however humble, teaches more than a grand design that does not.
- **Grow; never design the whole from scratch.** Each milestone evolves from the working system before it. When something cannot be grown, we begin again from a simpler thing that works, rather than patching a thing that never lived.
- **Prove each step through the gates.** Behavior preserved, shape additive, divergence caught — green before we compose the next layer.
- **Keep it loose and single-stranded.** Each part about one thing, composed side by side, so any one can be grown or replaced without unweaving the rest.
- **Stay in close touch with what each system is truly for.** We measure by whether the thing actually works for its purpose, not by how finished it looks.

## Where We Are Now — A Living Desktop Takes Shape on x86_64

Two things ran today that had not run before. Rishi gained integer arithmetic and a real stdout; Tally's first seed ran with 13 asserted invariants, all green. The design arc then caught up with and outpaced those new parts: four research and design documents landed in one session — POSIX at the door (`../external-research/977`), the full living desktop stack (`../external-research/978`), a quarantined native system interface brief (`../active-designing/985`), and a quarantined living desktop brief (`../active-designing/986`) — together with an expanded ordered plan (`../expanding-prompts/10009`) and a mapped strengthening frontier (passes 9994–9991).

The near goal is now concrete and named: **a Pond GUI running a Rishi REPL and live Mantra version control of `~/veganreyklah2`, in a native Brushstroke window on x86_64 AMD.** The dependency stack is charted six layers deep — from the existing foundation through strengthening passes, Tally v1, Mantra seed, Silo descriptor, Brushstroke seed, Mantra for the repo, and the Pond GUI milestone. The Aurora RISC-V arc continues in parallel on its own horizon; x86_64 is now the active build target where Pond, Brushstroke, and Rishi converge.

### What to Build Next, and Why

Four strengthening passes — SHA3-256, mem diff primitives, `std.fs` boundary assertions, `Dir.iterate` — stand between today's foundation and Mantra's seed. Run them first, each through the gate trio. Then River and Ghostty into `gratitude/`, the display-layer references Brushstroke's native backend reads from (clone these manually — the paths are `gratitude/river` and `gratitude/ghostty`). Then Rishi file I/O builtins, Mantra seed, and Brushstroke seed — the three seeds that compose into the Pond GUI. See `../expanding-prompts/10009` and `../active-designing/986`.

## The Steps Just Taken

Two small things ran that changed what was possible. **Rishi gained integer arithmetic** — `+`/`-`/`×`/`÷` with correct operator precedence via two-layer recursive descent, parenthesized grouping, and `say` rebound to stdout. Nine arithmetic assertions in `rishi/tests/arithmetic.rish`, all green. **Tally seed ran** — one `Region` struct, bump allocate, clear whole, 13 hosted `debug.assert` calls, all green in `tally/seed.rye`. Both were Horizon 1 items; Tally seed is now closed.

Alongside them, a new design arc opened in full. `POSIX at the door` (`977`) studied whether POSIX compliance is TAME style, read River and Ghostty as living demonstrations, and concluded: TAME-compatible, not TAME-native — the boundary wrapper is the move. `The living desktop stack` (`978`) mapped the full dependency chain toward a Pond GUI on x86_64 AMD, named Brushstroke as a web-browser-compatible face of Pond, and broadened Pond's purpose to the native desktop application framework. Both were quarantined into the clean room as `985` (native system interface) and `986` (living desktop). An expanded ordered plan — `10009` — names the eight implementation steps from today's foundation to the Pond GUI milestone.

The next reach is the four strengthening passes, then the three seeds.

*May we grow the whole from what already works, and trust each small running thing as it carries the next. May every horizon arrive by degrees, never by a leap. And may the system we are building stay simple enough, at every stage, to be loved, understood, and grown a little further tomorrow.*
