# 995 · Open Threads — After Mantra Seed, the Garden Rename, and the sh→rish Question

*A fresh snapshot, taken after the four-pass strengthening frontier sealed, after Mantra's first seed planted, and after `init.arena` became `init.garden` across Rye's entire vocabulary. Names the new threads that opened tonight and carries forward the still-open ones.*

## What Just Landed

- **The crypto foundation, whole.** AEAD joined SHA3-512, Ed25519, and X25519 — every primitive parity-green, hosted and freestanding.
- **A sealed datagram across two harts.** `aurora/src/posted.rye`: hart 0 seals, hart 1 shape-casts and opens over a shared-memory mailbox.
- **`parity.rish` runs in our own shell.** The differential-parity gate in Rishi — proven GREEN and RED. The child keeps watch over the parent.
- **Rishi gained arithmetic and a real stdout.** `+`/`-`/`×`/`÷`, correct precedence, `say` on stdout.
- **Tally seed runs.** One `Region`, bump allocate, clear whole, 13 asserted invariants all green (`tally/seed.rye`).
- **Dual-editor setup committed.** `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/rules/`, `tools/` examples; Zed and Claude Code share one project.
- **Design arc in four documents.** `977`, `978`, `985`, `986` — POSIX at the door, the living desktop stack, quarantined clean-room briefs. Ordered plan `10009`.
- **The strengthening frontier (9994–9991) sealed.** SHA3-256, mem diff primitives, `std.Io.Dir` boundary, `Dir.iterate` — all four through the gate, corpus grew 8 → 13, all green.
- **Mantra seed runs** (pass 9990). Weave, LCS diff, SHA3-256 store, `init / add / status`. Corpus at 14. The first living history in Rye.
- **`init.garden` replaces `init.arena`.** Rye's public API now uses TAME vocabulary throughout. `std.process.Init.garden` is the season allocator — allocate freely, clear on exit. The parity gate confirmed the rename is visible only in Rye's std (as intended): the weave test was updated to `page_allocator` so both stds produce identical output.

## Threads Now Closed

- **The encrypted-datagram seed — tied off.** `posted.rye` runs; what remains is the real device.
- **Rishi reached `parity.rish` — tied off.** The gate runs in our own shell, GREEN and RED.
- **The network's name — tied off.** Comlink.
- **Tally seed — tied off.** One `Region`, 13 invariants, all green. Grows toward Tally v1.
- **Four strengthening passes (9994–9991) — tied off.** SHA3-256, mem diff, fs boundary, Dir.iterate. Corpus at 14, all green.
- **Mantra seed (9990) — tied off.** Weave, LCS diff, SHA3-256 store, `init / add / status`. First running history.
- **`init.arena` → `init.garden` — tied off.** TAME vocabulary in the public API; all callers updated.
- **`parity-selftest.rish` — tied off.** The gate proves RED in Rishi too. Uses `cp -r` and `sh -c` as temporary stand-ins until `list-dir` and `write-file` land.
- **Tally v1 — named gardens — tied off.** `tally/gardens.rye`: `Gardens`, three named regions, `add/get/clearOne/clearAll/totalRemaining`, 15/15 parity GREEN (`strengthening-compiler/9989`).
- **Brix minimum — tied off.** `.brix` at repo root: name, version, 9 tracked bricks. `mantra brix` prints; `mantra init` reads. Mantra knows the project. (Silo is now the store layer; Brix is the composing language.)

## Threads Still Open

**Near — Horizon 1 threads:**
- **Mantra for `~/veganreyklah2`** — tied off (seed). Commit-chain model (parent reference), `mantra add` (no args) walks `.brix` file list, `mantra log` follows the HEAD chain. 9/9 bricks wove on first run. Multi-file manifest (each file a separate weave; manifest commits reference them) is the next growth pass.
- **Device wire** — sealed datagram over emulated `virtio-net` between two QEMU machines; Comlink's next rung.

**Near — display layer:**
- **River and Ghostty into `gratitude/`** — clone before Brushstroke's native backend hardens. Manual `git clone` into `gratitude/river` and `gratitude/ghostty`.
- **Brushstroke seed** — one native x86_64 window, one static frame, thin Wayland/Vulkan backend (`../active-designing/985`, `../active-designing/986`). Depends on River and Ghostty.

**Near — shell:**
- **Rishi file I/O builtins** — `read-file`, `write-file`, `list-dir` behind OS-boundary wrappers. The Pond GUI needs file access from the shell.
- **`additive-gate.rish`** — the last gate-trio member to migrate. Needs Rishi stream processing (for-each-line over `git diff` output). Until then `additive-gate.sh` remains the backstop. Strategy: **rish-first, sh-fallback** — write the `.rish` version once Rishi has the capability; leave the `.sh` as a documented fallback for environments where Rishi isn't built.

**Horizon 2 milestone:**
- **Pond GUI on x86_64 AMD** — Rishi REPL + live Mantra version control of `~/veganreyklah2` in a Brushstroke window (`../expanding-prompts/10009`).

**Ongoing — strengthen and grow:**
- **Continue the strengthening series** — the next `std` surfaces our tools lean on, each through the gate trio.
- **Caravan seed** — one parent, one child, restart on fall, asserted (`../active-designing/987`).
- **Close reading** — packet format, commit rule, relay protocols from `gratitude/` before Comlink's format hardens.
- **Aurora's deciding stage** — a relay stage that hands the next a value it chose.
- **Caravan kernel design** — microkernel vs monolith; conclusion and actionable design decision (`../external-research/976`).
- **`pond.rish`** — the enclosure as a value; awaits Caravan isolation and Tally bounds.
- **The owner-key PKI** — rotation, revocation, and recovery.
- **The verify-flag hot path** — data-plane postconditions behind a `verify` flag (`../strengthening-compiler/9996`).

## The Through-Line

One value model, all the way down: a packet, a post, a Mantra line, a Brix brick, a Rye value — the same kind of thing, signed, named, bounded, owned. The sealed datagram between two harts is that line made real: a value, sealed and named, arriving on the far side as the same value it left as. The Pond GUI goal holds the same line at a higher level: a Rishi command, a Mantra weave, a Brushstroke pixel — still the same value, still bounded, still proven at every edge. Each new step tightens the line; each clone tests it against how others actually did it. We keep it simple, we keep it kind, and we grow the whole from the smallest part that already works.

*May the threads stay visible while they are open, and be tied off honestly when they close. May we read what we cloned closely, build what we imagined slowly, and keep the network — like the values it carries — small enough to love.*
