# The Roadmap — Growing the Whole from What Already Works

*A living plan shaped by one law: a complex system that works grows from a simpler system that worked. We build by growing, and we ship something simple that runs at every step.*

## The Vision

**Rye OS** — a system that belongs wholly to the one who runs it. One language (Rye), one value model, one kernel (Caravan), one compositor (Brushstroke), one shell (Rishi), one version history (Mantra), one network (Comlink), one database (Tablecloth), one composition language (Brix), one data notation (Bron), one memory model (Tally), one boot (Aurora), one enclosure (Pond). **Linengrow** is the flagship application those modules serve — transparent civic commerce grown from the same spine. Each module individually simple; together they compose a desktop, a forge, a network, and a boot — on x86_64 today and RISC-V as the horizon.

**Rye today** is a thin, honest frontend on pinned Zig 0.16.0 — `rye/lib/std` leaned upon through pristine symlinks, safety living in authored `.rye` (assertions at call sites, `width-check.rish`, the gate trio). The strengthening chronicle **completed** as analysis; it is record, not product.

The full design lives in [`active-designing/20260619-225712_the-whole-system.md`](../active-designing/20260619-225712_the-whole-system.md). This roadmap says what to build and in what order.

## Two Tracks, One Spine

Rye OS is the system. **Linengrow** is the first whole built upon it — a transparent civic and social-commerce platform for vegan musicians and activist creators. The two share one architectural spine: state as a pure fold over an append-only log of immutable signed facts, and five foundations beneath everything — keypair, signed event, log, projection, capability.

Correctness by construction in the kernel becomes trust by construction in the platform. The same capability that isolates a process in Caravan names ownership in Linengrow; the same Mantra log that versions a file records a verifiable receipt; the same Comlink that seals a datagram delivers a signed transaction identity to identity. Rye OS grows the infrastructure rings; Linengrow grows its application rings on the same modules. The full Linengrow vision lives in [`../linengrow/`](../linengrow/); this roadmap grows it the SLC way, smallest lovable complete first. The granular plan for both tracks lives in [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md).

## The Ground — What Already Runs

| Module | Seed | Witnesses |
|--------|------|-----------|
| **Rye** | Thin frontend; `rye/lib/std` → vendor symlink | 116 witness regression suite |
| **Aurora** | Six-stage relay + deciding stage on RISC-V | Freestanding |
| **Caravan** | seed → bounded → twin → chain | Hosted, asserted |
| **Tally** | seed + named gardens (blob/diff/frame) | 15 invariants |
| **Brix** | `.brix` descriptor, 10 tracked bricks | Read by Mantra |
| **Tablecloth** | General-purpose database + object storage | Designed (future) |
| **Bron** | Data notation (`.bron`) | Used by `.brix` |
| **Mantra** | Weave + commit chain + add-all + log | 9/9 bricks wove |
| **Rishi** | Shell: typed values, file I/O, string builtins; **`repl`** — type, run, version, recall (SLC-1 **done**) | Gate trio + four SLC-1 witnesses incl. `slc1_accept.rish` |
| **Brushstroke** | Hosted seed + Wayland seed (one window) | Frame from values |
| **Skate** | Text grid: 8×8 monospace on Wayland | Headless selftest |
| **Comlink** | Sealed datagram: shared-memory + localhost UDP | Full crypto stack |
| **Pond** | Policy as a value (`pond.rish`) | Designed |

**Strengthening arc:** complete — chronicle + lexicon at `strengthening-compiler/0000_STRENGTHENING_LEXICON.md`; call-site harvest at [`archive/20260628-044200_call-site-harvest.md`](archive/20260628-044200_call-site-harvest.md).

**Gate trio:** `parity.rish` (120 witnesses — 116 `rye run` + four SLC-1), `parity-selftest.rish` (std symlink guard), `additive-gate.rish` (structural std diff — applies when `rye/lib/` changes in HEAD). All in Rishi. **Status:** parity + selftest green on metal (`2026-06-29`); additive-gate runs when std changes land.

## The Primary Track — Simple, Lovable, Complete wholes

Grow running seeds into things a person can use *as-is*. See [`gratitude/Your customers hate MVPs. Make a SLC instead..html`](../gratitude/Your%20customers%20hate%20MVPs.%20Make%20a%20SLC%20instead..html).

| Ring | What | Status |
|------|------|--------|
| **SLC 1** | **Rishi + Mantra shell** — hosted, scriptable REPL with versioned history in a terminal (type → run → version → recall) | **Done** (`2026-06-29`) — four verbs + `tools/slc1_accept.rish`; scope [`20260628-071012`](../active-designing/20260628-071012_slc-1-rishi-mantra-shell.md). Width/TAME hardening is the **next milestone**, not part of this close. |
| **SLC 2** | **Pond GUI** — same loop in Brushstroke/Skate window on x86_64 | After Skate text rendering |
| **Compose** | Comlink device wire → capability table → Comlink v1 → Brix v1 → Tablecloth → Forge | Horizon 2 |

**Authored width migration** (Phase 1b: `brushstroke/*` done; **`mantra/*` next**) continues — good Tiger on its own, enforced by `width-check.rish`; **not** fork-work.

---

## The Linengrow Track — Trust by Construction

Grown from the same modules Rye OS is already building, smallest lovable complete first.

| Ring | What | Grows from |
|------|------|-----------|
| **SLC-L1** | A verifiable receipt — sign a transaction fact, append it to the log, produce a receipt anyone can verify | keypair + Mantra log + projection |
| **SLC-L2** | Sealed delivery — a signed receipt sent identity to identity, under seal | Comlink |
| **SLC-L3** | Settlement — a transaction settled on Sui with USDsui, verifiable on the ledger | Sui / Mysticeti |
| **SLC-L4** | The selective-disclosure pass — a zero-knowledge credential proving a claim without revealing the data behind it | keypair + Sui ZK foundations |
| **Horizon** | The data market, premium tiers, state-currency circulation, the PBC and its rounds | the business model in `../linengrow/` |

The first ring needs no ledger and no currency — only the foundations Rye OS already grows.

---

## Horizon 3 — Deliberated horizons (not today's primary track)

| Horizon | What |
|---------|------|
| **Language fork** | Self-hosted compiler, Rye-native `std` — revisited from a **mature whole** when RISC-V-first genuinely demands it ([`20260628-043542` direction](../active-designing/20260628-043542_thin-frontend-slc-direction.md)) |
| **Whole machine** | Aurora on RISC-V, full desktop, Brushstroke web-portable, Rye OS on open silicon |
| **Inference stack** | Lantern, Lattice, Anvil — after the living desktop composes |

Prior fork steps F0–F5 remain documented in [`active-designing/20260621-070712_the-compiler-fork.md`](../active-designing/20260621-070712_the-compiler-fork.md) as **research**, not the active build order.

## Horizon 1 — What to Build Next

### Build (SLC 1 first)

**Gate before the SLC-1 merge:** ~~`rishi/bin/rishi run tools/parity.rish` green once on metal~~ **done** (`2026-06-28`) — 116 witnesses + `slc1_repl_step1.rish` registered in parity.

**SLC-1 build order** (granular; mirrors [`TASKS.md`](TASKS.md)):

| Step | Verb | What lands | Witness |
|------|------|------------|---------|
| **1 — type + run** | Type, Run | `rishi repl`; prompt `rishi> `; in-process eval; shared `Env`; `:quit` / `:q` | `tools/slc1_repl_step1.rish` — binding carry-forward |
| **2 — version** | Version | Session buffer; `.mantra/session.log` transcript; `:history`; lazy `mantra init`; `:version` → `mantra add` | `tools/slc1_version_step2.rish` — HEAD advances; blob in `.mantra/blobs/` |
| **3 — recall** | Recall | `:recall <n>` and `!<n>`; in-session ring via `runInputLine` | `tools/slc1_recall_step3.rish` — prior line re-runs |
| **accept** | all four | Meta-commands in `rishi/README`; gate trio on metal | `tools/slc1_accept.rish` — type, run, version, recall in one session |

**SLC-1 is done** on its functional promise (`2026-06-29`). **TAME hardening is complete** (`2026-06-29`) — TH-0–TH-7, RS-1–RS-3, hosted `width-check` blocking in parity (132 witnesses). The bench turns to the next product ring.

1. **Skate text rendering** — text on screen; unlocks SLC-2 (Pond GUI). *Scope and acceptance need a Claude ruling before bench work.*
2. **Caravan capability table** — small Rye struct naming what each child may do; first step toward the microkernel.
3. **Comlink device wire** — sealed datagram over virtio-net between two QEMU guests.
4. **Rishi builtins** — trim improvements still open (optional, as-you-touch).
5. **Width migration Phase 1b** — `mantra/*` and remaining authored surfaces; decoupled from fork; as-you-touch beside SLC-2.

### Ground (thin frontend)

7. **Std re-fork** — **done** (`20260628`) — pristine symlink; see [`archive/20260628-044300_std-refork-plan.md`](archive/20260628-044300_std-refork-plan.md).

### Study

8. **Display-layer study** — Wayland specs; Ghostty (MIT) for Skate.
9. **Close reading** — Comlink packet format from `gratitude/` before format hardens.

**Retired from active track:** strengthening sweep; pass 9886 as chronicle continuation; "fork is the priority."

- [ ] **Pond v1** — policy as value
- [ ] **The Forge** — Mantra served, Brushstroke drawn, Comlink replicated
- [ ] **The TAME Editor** — select-then-act in Skate
- [ ] **Comlink Remoting** — value-based state sync over UDP
- [ ] **Unified keys** — one owner seed deriving all keys

## The Discipline

- **Ship something simple, lovable, and complete at every step.**
- **Grow; never design the whole from scratch.**
- **Prove each step through the gates.**
- **Safety lives in authored code** — assert at call sites; pristine `std` you lean on.
- **Keep it loose and single-stranded.**
- **Two-thirds implementation, one-third design.**

---

*May we grow the whole from what already works, and trust each small running thing as it carries the next. May every horizon arrive by degrees, never by a leap. And may the system we build stay simple enough, at every stage, to be loved, understood, and grown a little further tomorrow.*
