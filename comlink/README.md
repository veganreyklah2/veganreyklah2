# Comlink — the Sealed Wire, Hosted and on Real Virtio

**Language:** EN
**Last updated:** 2026-07-09 (MALA M2b device wire ports **15569**/**15570**)
**Style:** Radiant (see `../context/RADIANT_STYLE.md`)

**Comlink carries a sealed datagram, and the format never forks.** `wire_format.rye` defines one offset layout and one seal/open pair, and every rung above it — a hosted UDP socket on localhost, or a real virtio-net link between two freestanding guests on QEMU virt — reads and writes exactly the same bytes. A fact that crosses this wire arrives whole or not at all; nothing here retries a partial frame.

## The Core

| File | Proves |
|------|--------|
| [`wire_format.rye`](wire_format.rye) | the sealed datagram layout every rung shares — offsets and crypto identical across shared memory, hosted UDP, and virtio-net |
| [`hosted_wire.rye`](hosted_wire.rye) | the same sealed datagram crosses a real localhost UDP socket |
| [`virtio_net.rye`](virtio_net.rye) | virtio-net MMIO types and the freestanding driver seed — shared by hosted descriptor validation and real guests on QEMU virt |
| [`device_wire.rye`](device_wire.rye) | descriptor algebra proven on a fixture, then the same crossing proven on a real virtio link between two guests |

`device_wire.rye`'s hosted selftest is the fast path — no QEMU, and it is where `virtio_net.rye`'s five hand-designed wire structures (`VirtioNetHdr`, `VqDesc`, `VqAvail`, `VqUsedElem`, `VqUsed`) get proved padding-free at compile time via Tally's `no_padding`, before anything freestanding ever runs. A stale camelCase-era call site (`negotiateFeatures` where `virtio_net.rye` had already migrated to `negotiate_features`) sat undetected here for one full season, because nothing in the parity suite ever built this file's own hosted binary — only the freestanding lab downstream of it. Both the rename and the gap are closed: [`counsel/20260707-053212_tigerbeetle-alignment-study.md`](../external-research/20260707-053212_tigerbeetle-alignment-study.md) named the discipline, this season's bench found where it had not yet reached.

## The Guest Fleet

Every Mantra and Linengrow wire capability that crosses onto real virtio carries a matched pair of freestanding guests — one transmitting, one receiving — named for the capability they prove: `pattern`, `sealed`, `receipt`, `sync`, `batch`, `2way`, `catchup` (with revision-numbered variants `_r2`/`_r3` as the catch-up protocol grew a second and third rung), `snapshot`, and the full `open_asks` ladder (`application`, `acceptance`, `escrow_hold`, `escrow_release`, `completion`, `consent`, plus `poster` and the bare `open_asks` request pair). Forty-three guest files in total, each one small and single-purpose by design — a guest proves one crossing, not a general-purpose client.

## Port Map

| Capability | Hosted | Device |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Recall sync | 38478 / 38479 | 15561 / 15562 |
| Recall batch | 38480 / 38481 | 15563 / 15564 |
| Two-way sync | 38482 / 38483 | — |
| Catch-up | 38484 / 38485 | — |
| Subscribe poll | 38486 / 38487 | 15565 / 15566 |
| Open Asks (OA-L5) | 38488 / 38489 | 15561–15563 |
| Snapshot lap 3 | 38490 / 38491 | 15567 / 15568 |
| MALA M2 / M2b | 38492 / 38493 | 15569 / 15570 |

Ports repeat across unrelated laps by design — each witness binds, uses, and releases its own pair within one bounded run, and Comlink's laps never run concurrently against the same address.

*May a sealed datagram always mean the same bytes, whichever rung carries it. May every guest prove exactly the one crossing it was built for. And may a hosted check always exist beside a freestanding one, so nothing waits a whole season to be found.*
