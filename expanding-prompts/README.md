# Expanding Prompts

*A place where a request becomes a plan. When you hand me a seed of intent, I bring it here, read it closely through every lens we have built, and craft from it a fuller, clearer prompt for myself — one I can then run. The seed stays yours; the expansion is how I make sure I have understood it, sharpened it, and lost none of it.*

## Why This Stack Exists

A prompt is a seed. It carries intent — often more than its words say outright, and sometimes a little less than it means. The other stacks here grow outward from decisions already made; this one grows *inward* first. It takes what you asked and expands it into a working specification before any of it is built.

The practice is simple, and I mean it kindly: I restate your intent in full, I name the deliverables plainly, I apply our active-designing principles, our TAME lens, and the radiant voice, and I add the questions and structure that will make the work good. Then I run that expanded prompt. Nothing of yours is dropped; what I add is scaffolding, never substitution.

Why keep them at all? Because a prompt well understood is half the work, and a prompt misunderstood is the most expensive mistake there is. Writing the expansion down lets you see how I heard you — and correct me before, not after.

## One clock, one order

Dated prompts carry `YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS_short-slug.md`; this README is the living foundation. Full naming law: [`../context/specs/20260627-102012_one-clock-naming-law.md`](../context/specs/20260627-102012_one-clock-naming-law.md).

**Consumed prompts** — including executed `cursor-*` bench passes and legacy `cursor-prompt_*` files from the one-clock reorg — rest in [`yonder/`](yonder/) when the work they drove has landed. Session logs record the outcome; the prompt stays as an honest record of how the request was expanded.

## Redirects and retired patterns

**Executed prompts** become redirect stubs at the stub-event stamp `20260621-051612` with distinct `-redirect` slugs. See also [`../external-research/README.md`](../external-research/README.md).

## What Belongs Here

- The expanded prompt itself: my improved, structured reading of a request.
- A faithful echo of the original intent, so the seed is never lost.
- The lens applied: which principles and filters shaped the expansion.
- The plan I will run, and the deliverables it should produce.

What does *not* belong here is the work itself — that lands in the research, design, and code stacks. This is only where intent is sharpened into a plan.

*May every seed be heard in full. May what I add only clarify, never crowd. And may the prompt I write for myself stay truer to your meaning than the bare words could carry alone.*
