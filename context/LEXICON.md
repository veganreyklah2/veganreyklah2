# Lexicon — Module Names and Their Meanings

**Language:** EN
**Last updated:** 2026-07-02 (Rio round; Maitreya owns time)
**Style:** Radiant (see `RADIANT_STYLE.md`)

Living vocabulary for the Rye OS family. Each name teaches its function. Provenance for the three names given on 2026-06-30 lives in `specs/20260630-004512_module-name-provenance.md`. Module, aspect, and the graduation rule: [`specs/20260702-035018_graduation-rule.md`](specs/20260702-035018_graduation-rule.md).

## Pattern — module and aspect

| Term | One line |
|------|----------|
| **Module** | A named home — its own directory, invariants, budgets, witnesses |
| **Aspect** | A named capability inside a module's boundary, sharing the host's budget, owning no directory of its own |
| **Graduation** | An aspect becomes a module when its **second consumer** arrives from outside its host |

## Core stack

| Name | One line |
|------|----------|
| **Aurora** | The boot — dawn on open hardware |
| **Tally** | Memory in bounded gardens |
| **Caravan** | Supervision and capabilities |
| **Weave** | The append-only DAG of immutable signed facts — substrate beneath Mantra and Comlink; **aspect of Mantra** today at `mantra/src/weave.rye` |
| **Mantra** | Version-control projection over Weave |
| **Comlink** | Transport of sealed facts over Weave |
| **Brushstroke** | The drawn surface — values to pixels, immediate-mode |
| **Skate** | Text grid → pixel buffer (aspect of Brushstroke today) |
| **Maitreya** | Media driver — **time** for audio and video: decode, sync, bounded buffers; Brushstroke owns space; Lotus authors above; Realidream and Linengrow play through one seam; codecs as royalty-free host seams |
| **Lotus** | Our digital audio workstation — hot-loop studio above Maitreya; horizon after SLC-2 |
| **Uddhava** | Spatial driver — real-time 3D, CAD, and scene graph (horizon; Unity-shaped role in our vocabulary) |
| **Pond** | The bounded enclosure for an agent — packaging's runtime target under policy |
| **Rishi** | The shell — the faithful hand |
| **Rye** | The language and value model |
| **Brix** | What a system is made of — lawful composition |
| **Tablecloth** | Application data store (horizon — role still shaping) |
| **Bron** | Data notation between modules (`.bron`) |
| **Amber** | Preservation — signed, encrypted, bit-faithful archives on deep storage, recorded in an append-only log and verified by folding; Mantra holds the living history, Amber seals the moment cold |

## Named tonight (`2026-06-30`)

| Name | One line | Provenance gloss |
|------|----------|------------------|
| **Dexter** | Input — keyboard and pointer events into the fold, on both display backends | Dexterity, the skillful acting hand; an echo of one who texts; family memory after a grandfather's enterprise (Zendex, Robert Sealy Livermore) |
| **Kumara** | Identity — the keypair that signs a fact before it enters Weave | The eternal, ever-pure sage-children of the Bhagavata, Sanat-kumara among them |
| **Bookie** | The borrow discipline — who may change a value and who may only witness it | A turf accountant keeping the ledger straight; watches ownership, not value shape |

## Open (named, not yet shaped)

| Name | Status |
|------|--------|
| **MALA** | Named (`2026-07-02`) — mailable money: issuer-signed token facts on the log, balance as a fold; ladder M0–M4 in [`active-designing/20260702-031312_modules-aspects-and-mailable-money.md`](../active-designing/20260702-031312_modules-aspects-and-mailable-money.md); first ring after Edit 5 and Amber |
| **Mycelium** | Named (`2026-07-02`) — Comlink's ordering aspect for the many-issuer horizon: leaderless agreement on a DAG of signed messages; gated at MALA M4, never before |
| **Puddle** | Named (`2026-07-02`) — VM exploration: sandboxed Rye OS containers with own Pond and Kumara; Amber state-as-snapshot; [`external-research/20260702-035018_puddle-sandboxed-rye-containers.md`](../external-research/20260702-035018_puddle-sandboxed-rye-containers.md) |
| **Bron** | Proposed — composing companion beside Brix; role open for Kaeden |
| **Tablecloth** | Named — layout or structured-view layer; horizon |
| **`.brush`** | Surface-description extension when Brushstroke earns a small language |

*May each name carry its idea. May the lexicon grow only when a name earns its place.*
