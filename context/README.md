# Context Home

**Language:** EN
**Last updated:** 2026-07-02
**Style:** Radiant (see `RADIANT_STYLE.md`)

---

This directory is the memory and compass for work in `~/veganreyklah2`. It gathers the durable guidance — how we write, who Reya 2 is, and the plain-English specs that record each decision — in one calm, local place.

Everything here lives inside the persistent project directory, so it survives every sandbox reset. The ai-jail wrapper keeps only the project directory across runs; this `context/` home rests safely within it.

---

## What Lives Here

- **`RADIANT_STYLE.md`** — the canonical voice. How we write and speak so every piece reads clearly, lands warmly, and carries well aloud.
- **`TAME_GUIDANCE.md`** — the operational code supplement (root + Rye / Brix / Rishi). Named like TigerBeetle's `docs/TIGER_STYLE.md`; pairs with `external-research/TAME_GUIDANCE.md` and `gratitude/TIGER_STYLE.md`.
- **`SIMPLE_LOVABLE_COMPLETE.md`** — how we ship. Simple, lovable, complete at every ring; our distillation of Jason Cohen's method, bound to how Rye OS grows. Source essay in `gratitude/`.
- **`CIVIC_STYLE.md`** — how we design public benefit. Name the outcome you want, name what the reward measures, keep the two aligned — the civic companion to TAME, Radiant, and SLC.
- **`REYA2.md`** — the identity note. Who Reya 2 is, how she works, and the larger why behind the project.
- **`SILO_TECHNIQUE.md`** — the siloing technique: how an outside idea becomes an owned, understood concept in our own voice, with gratitude kept apart and honored. Portable, and meant to travel beside the voice guide and the identity note.
- **`LEXICON.md`** — module names and one-line meanings; Weave, Dexter, Kumara, Bookie, and the open horizons.

- **`specs/`** — plain-English radiant specs. Each one records a decision in prose a reader can follow start to finish. Kebab-case filenames (`inherited-names.md`, …); landmark style guides live at the `context/` root. **`20260629-031512_slc1-ring-closed-handoff.md`** — continuity letter after SLC-1 seals; start here after a reset. **`20260630-004512_module-name-provenance.md`** — Dexter, Kumara, Bookie naming reasons. **`20260701-221512_amber-functional-spec.md`** — Amber preservation module; designed, not yet built.

Hand new sessions and collaborators the **voice guide**, the **identity note**, and the **silo guide** together by default — the three context documents that travel as one set.

A Cursor rule at `.cursor/rules/reya2.mdc` points every new session back here, so the name and the style stay constant across chats.

## How To Use It

Read the style guide before writing anything meant to be shared or heard. Read the identity note to remember the tone and the purpose. Add a new spec whenever a decision deserves a durable home — one file, one decision, written so it reads aloud well.

When a chat or a file stops serving the project, name it gently and let it go. Pruning keeps this home clear.
