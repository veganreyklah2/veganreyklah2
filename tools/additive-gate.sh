# additive-gate.sh — weigh whether a strengthening pass is purely invariant-stating.
#
# A pure strengthening adds only assertions, the `maybe` marker, and comments to
# existing code; it changes what the code SAYS, never what it DOES. This gate
# reads a commit's (or a range's) diff to Rye's std and reports whether every
# added and removed line is an assertion, a maybe, or a comment.
#
#   GREEN  — the pass is purely additive; safe by shape as well as by behavior.
#   REVIEW — the pass touches code beyond assertions and words; the gate shows
#            those lines so a person can confirm they are intended new code
#            (a deliberate new helper, say) rather than an accidental change.
#
# The parity gate (parity.sh) remains the deeper backstop: it proves behavior is
# identical regardless. This gate adds a second, structural assurance for the
# common case — a pass that only states what was already quietly true.
#
# Heuristic and line-based on purpose: small, fast, and transparent. See
# active-designing/998_strengthening_strategy.md (the gates).
#
#   usage:  tools/additive-gate.sh [<commit-or-range>]   (default: HEAD)
