# parity.sh — the differential-parity gate of the strengthening-compiler.
#
# For each program in the corpus, run it against the pristine BASELINE standard
# library and against Rye's STRENGTHENED standard library, and confirm the
# outputs (and exit codes) match to the byte. A strengthening is safe only while
# this stays green: we add what the code SAYS, never what it DOES — so the
# observable behavior of every program must be identical on both libraries.
#
# This is the gate's smallest honest form, buildable now from what we already
# have. The corpus is small today and grows with every pass and every test.
#
# See active-designing/998_strengthening_strategy.md for why this comes first.
