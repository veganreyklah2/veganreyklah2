# Pass 9988 · allocPrint and trimEnd — the path conversion and parsing layer

**Corpus:** 16 programs (grew from 15)
**Gate:** GREEN — parity confirmed
**Stamp:** `20260619.225712`

## What this pass covers

Two `std` functions our recent code depends on, now exercised in the parity corpus:

1. **`std.fmt.allocPrint`** — allocates a formatted, sentinel-terminated string. Used in Rishi's file I/O builtins (`doReadFile`, `doListDir`, `doWriteFile`) to convert Rishi string values (non-sentinel `[]const u8`) to OS-boundary-safe `[:0]u8` paths. Also used in Mantra's `Store` methods for path construction.

2. **`std.mem.trimEnd`** — removes trailing characters from a slice. Used in Rishi's arithmetic parser (`findLastArithAdd`) to detect binary operators by checking that the trimmed left side ends with a value token rather than another operator.

## What the test asserts

- `allocPrint` produces output matching the format exactly (string interpolation, integer formatting, identity formatting)
- Output length matches expected values
- `trimEnd` removes only trailing matches, leaves leading characters untouched
- `trimEnd` on an empty string returns empty
- `trimEnd` result length is always <= input length

## Design notes

The test uses `page_allocator` (not `init.garden`) so it compiles identically against both the baseline and Rye's strengthened std — the same pattern `mantra_weave_test` and `tally_gardens_test` keep.
