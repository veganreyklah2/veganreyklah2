# 9992 · FS Boundary — Asserting at the Door of Every Path Call

*The native system interface (`../active-designing/985`) asks that unsafe OS idioms appear only inside wrapper functions that assert at entry before crossing the boundary. Four functions in `rye/lib/std/Io/Dir.zig` are the door our file I/O walks through: `openFile`, `createFile`, `readFile`, and `writeFile`. This pass places the boundary assertions at each door — path non-empty, path within the OS limit, read buffer non-empty — and confirms the parity gate stays green.*

## The Boundary

In Rye 0.16.0, `std.fs` is deprecated and all file system operations live in `std.Io.Dir`. Four functions gate every file operation our code will make:

- **`openFile`** — opens a file relative to a directory handle; the path-relative pattern from the `*at` syscall family
- **`createFile`** — creates or truncates a file relative to a directory handle
- **`readFile`** — opens, reads into a caller-provided buffer, and closes
- **`writeFile`** — creates/truncates, writes all data, and closes; takes a `WriteFileOptions` struct whose `sub_path` field is the path

The `*Absolute` variants already carry `assert(path.isAbsolute(...))` — the style of boundary assertion that was already present. This pass adds the two path-length assertions to the relative-path functions, which were unguarded.

---

## The Four Assertions

### Path non-empty

```zig
assert(sub_path.len > 0); // empty path is always a caller error
```

An empty path string is never a valid file name on any OS. Passing one to the vtable dispatch would reach the kernel with a zero-length argument, producing a silent `ENOENT` or `EINVAL`. The assertion converts that silent late failure into a loud local stop at the exact point the invalid argument was passed.

Applied to: `openFile`, `createFile`, `readFile` (as `file_path`), `writeFile` (as `options.sub_path`).

### Path within the OS limit

```zig
assert(sub_path.len < max_path_bytes); // path fits within the declared OS limit
```

`max_path_bytes` is the platform-specific maximum path length (4096 on Linux, including the null terminator). A path at or beyond this limit cannot be passed to the kernel as a null-terminated C string without overflowing the OS buffer. The assertion catches over-long paths before they reach `openat`/`creat`, where the error would arrive as `ENAMETOOLONG` — a valid yet opaque error return. The assertion is `<`, not `<=`, because `max_path_bytes` includes the null sentinel byte: a path of `max_path_bytes - 1` bytes would just fit; one of `max_path_bytes` would not.

Applied to: `openFile`, `createFile`, `readFile`, `writeFile`.

### Read buffer non-empty

```zig
assert(buffer.len > 0); // a zero-length buffer reads nothing; pass a real buffer
```

Applied only to `readFile`. Passing a zero-length buffer reads zero bytes and returns `buffer[0..0]`, which is technically correct yet almost certainly a mistake. The assertion names this at the door.

---

## Where `writeFile` Sits

`writeFile` calls `createFile`, which already carries the path assertions after this pass. The assertion at `writeFile` itself is intentionally redundant:

```zig
// (createFile below will also assert these; stating them here names the contract
// at the level the caller sees, before any vtable dispatch.)
assert(options.sub_path.len > 0);
assert(options.sub_path.len < max_path_bytes);
var file = try dir.createFile(io, options.sub_path, options.flags);
```

The principle: assert at every public surface the caller sees, not only at the innermost call. A future maintainer who calls `writeFile` directly benefits from the assertion appearing at the function they called, rather than discovering it only if they trace into `createFile`.

---

## The Test Pattern: `pub fn main(init: std.process.Init) !u8`

The `std.Io.Dir` API requires an `Io` handle, which comes from `init.io`. All previous parity tests used `pub fn main() void` (pure computation, no I/O handle needed). This test introduces a second entry-point pattern: `pub fn main(init: std.process.Init) !u8`, which `zig run` supports and which gives access to the full I/O system.

The test writes a known string to `/tmp/rye_fs_boundary_test.txt`, reads it back into a 64-byte buffer, asserts the round-trip matches, opens the file once more via `openFile`, then deletes the temp file via `deleteFile`. All four strengthened functions are exercised with valid arguments, the live assertions run, and neither fires.

## Parity Result

```
PARITY    fs_boundary_test.rye
PARITY    mem_diff_test.rye
... (10 prior entries, all PARITY) ...
---
parity gate: 12 matched, 0 diverged across 12 programs
GREEN: Rye's std is behavior-identical to the baseline across the corpus.
```

Twelve programs, all green. The write-then-read round-trip produced identical output on both stds, confirming the added assertions compile to nothing in the observable behavior and fire only when an invariant is broken.

## Files

| File | Why |
|------|-----|
| `rye/lib/std/Io/Dir.zig` | Four functions strengthened: `openFile`, `createFile`, `readFile`, `writeFile` |
| `rye/tests/fs_boundary_test.rye` | Write–read–open round-trip exercising all four functions |
| `tools/parity.sh` | Corpus extended to 12 programs |
| `tools/parity.rish` | Same corpus extension |
| `strengthening-compiler/9992_fs_boundary.md` | This record |

*May every path that reaches the OS boundary be non-empty and within the declared limit. May the buffer that awaits a file's contents be ready to receive. May the door hold cleanly — a loud stop near the cause, and the room behind it clean.*
